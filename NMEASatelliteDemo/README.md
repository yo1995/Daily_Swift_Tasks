Get the satellite coordinates in Geographic Coordinate System and render their positions in 3D.

This app demonstrates how to convert the azimuth-elevation coordinates notation of a satellite into latitude longitude coordinates.

## Description

A GNSS/GPS receiver periodically reports the satellites information with NMEA sentences. A `$GPGSV` sentence follows the GNSS Satellites In View specification. Per its spec doc:

> The GSV sentence provides the number of satellites (SV) in view, satellite ID numbers, elevation,
azimuth, and SNR value. The GSV sentence contains four satellites maximum per transmission. The
total number of sentences being transmitted and the sentence number being transmitted are indicated in
the first two fields.
