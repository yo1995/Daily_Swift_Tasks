# Seattle Fireworks Seeker

![demo](title.png)

This is the 2nd demo I showed in 2022 Esri Summer Intern Program - Tech Tuesday event on 20220802, *ArcGIS Runtime Developer Technology Made Easy*.

This app demonstrates how easy it is to write a native and performant 3D analysis app on iOS using ArcGIS Runtime.

I went to Seattle for the first time during the July 4th weekend. My friends and I wanted to find the best spot to observe the fireworks ðŸŽ† in Seattle, which is set off in the middle of Lake Union this year. Initially we planned to go to one of the taller Amazon buildings, but that is such a hassle; we then explored options such as Space Needle, top floor of his apartment building, SLU waterfront.

Eventually I decided to write an app to scientifically settle the discussion by using a 3D viewshed that shows the view obstruction situation near downtown Seattle. Thanks to City of Seattle's GIS data, I manage to show the result with 3D building models.
